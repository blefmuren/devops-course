# Hello.


For the last 15 years I have been working in IT. Mostly as a system administrator, but for the last 5 years I have been doing work closer and closer to DevOps.Faced many technologies but most often without immersion.

I know Windows systems well, and I want to know Unix systems well.

I think that a really lazy person can be a good sysadmin/devops. Try to automate any task that is performed more than once.

Last time basically I write PS scripts for monitoring systems / applications, and for deployment.
Recently, I have been dealing with databases a lot (deployment, optimization, interaction with developers)

***What interested me in the course?***

* Practice of working with Unix system.

* Get acquainted with the work experience of another team.

* And in general, without a task, self-learning is boring).

* Also periodically it is necessary to perform the PM function.

*...if you want it to be good, do it well.*
